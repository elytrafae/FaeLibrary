This is a Library mod that I wanna use to make mods.

However, other mod developers may find the library's features useful as well, such as:
- Additional player stats (ranged velocity, summon speed, summon effectiveness, mount stats, melee size etc)
- System to fetch the NPC that created a given projectile, if it exists
- Lots of projectile hooks, like dynamically adjusting summon tag effectiveness, tick rate, or dynamically updating damage/crit/armorpen of "Continously Updating" projectiles
- An Item Condition system
- A custom item slot implementation, able to fully control what can and cannot go into the slot
- And more!
